This project implements a video classification pipeline using the state-of-the-art VideoMAE model. It allows you to:

Train VideoMAE on your custom video dataset.
Test and evaluate the trained model's performance.
Perform inference, classifying new unseen videos using the trained model.

This project empowers you to leverage the power of VideoMAE for your specific video classification tasks on custom data.
